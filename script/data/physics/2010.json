    "question": "An object is weighted at different locations on the earth. What will be the right observation?",
    "option_a": "Both the mass and weight are constant",
    "option_b": "Both the mass and weight vary",
    "option_c": "the mass is constant while the weight varies",
    "option_d": "the weight is constant while the mass varies",
    "answer": "C",
    "solution": "The weight of a body is the resultant of earth's gravitational pull on it. The earth is not a perfect sphere, it is more flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. Hence an object at the pole is closer to the earth's center than the one at the equator. The weight of a body at the poles should be more than that of when weighed at the equator.<br> \nThus weight varies from place to place while the mass of a body being the quantity of matter it contains remains the same at different points on the earth."
