    "question": "If the volume of a gas increases steadily as the temperature decreases at constant pressure, the gas obeys",
    "option_a": "Graham's Law",
    "option_b": "Boyle's Law",
    "option_c": "Pressure law",
    "option_d": "Charles Law",
    "answer": "E",
    "solution": "Rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of density - Graham's law <br>  \\( P \\propto \\frac{1}{v} \\) at constant temperature - Boyle's law<br> \\( P \\propto T \\) at constant volume - Pressure law<br> \\( P \\propto T \\) at constant pressure - Charles law<br> therefore no correct option"

    "question": "In Homes, electrical appliances and lamps are connected in parallel because",
    "option_a": "Parallel connections do not heat up the wires",
    "option_b": "series connections use high voltage",
    "option_c": "less current will be used",
    "option_d": "less voltage will be used",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "if appliances are connected in series, the effective voltage is the sum of individual voltages which will be high."
